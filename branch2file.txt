I have sort of the same problem since the 4.4.2 update - I see the download, but I don't see the installation after it downloads. I don't think it's something you did, I think it's something in the Note 3 4.4.2 update.

Welcome to Android Central! Go to the App Manager, select Download Manager, and Force Stop, then Clear Cache/ClearData. Now try again.

Rukbat, are you saying you don't see the download in the Downloads app? Or the installed app doesn't show up in the App Drawer?

In my case on an LG G2 running 4.4.2 kitkat, I never see progress of podcast downloads, just a notification when complete. The weird thing is that i was using ES Downloader and it worked great but now is nowhere to be found - although i didn't delete the program, i did try reinstalling it regardless, but get an error message. Downloaded audio goes to my music folder; no clue about folders in general! Thanks

In the apps section of the setting, the Download manager is a system app, you will need to go up to the three dot menu and choose show system apps to see it...

samsung tab S2 9.7: same problem since update to android 7. Tried Muiriddin suggestion in download manager, re-started tablet, same problem. Any other solutions? Would so much like to see the download progress again. Thank you.
